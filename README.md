# AndroidStudioXcodeTheme
An Android Studio / IntelliJ color theme that looks suspiciously like Xcode's built-in Midnight theme.

The .jar file represents my exported Android Studio settings. It contains a modified version of the Xcode Midnight theme for IntelliJ IDEA [found here](http://www.ideacolorthemes.org/themes/43/). I tweaked the original to be closer to Xcode's built in theme. Less blue and more green.

To install 
- Download the jar file
- Android Studio -> File -> Import Settings -> Select Jar
- Select Xcode Midnight as the theme in Settings -> Editor -> Colors & Fonts
